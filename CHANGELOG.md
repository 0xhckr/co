# Changelog

All notable changes are documented here. This project follows semantic versioning.

## [Unreleased]

- Request human-approved agent repository access for up to 30 days with `co access request --ttl 2592000`. Existing grants keep their original expiry.

## [0.7.0] - 2026-09-28

- Fix machine enrollment on macOS when system utilities are absent from `PATH`.
- Send only new workflow output and verify cumulative log integrity, automatically repairing missing or mismatched logs.
- Show workflow output while steps run, recover log updates after temporary disconnects, and retain more output with explicit truncation notices.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-27

- Add explicit agent Git credentials through `CO_AGENT_ID`, scoped to the approved repository and refusing human-credential fallback.
- Add `co agent attest` to record authenticated participation in explicitly selected commits after pushing.
- Add machine enrollment with a setup key or an authorized owner session, saved machine identities, and reconnecting heartbeats.
- Add `co machine run` to execute assigned workflow jobs at their exact commit, with isolated steps, time limits, cancellation, and bounded logs.
- Add `co workflow check` to validate local workflow files and report file and line diagnostics.
- Keep newly configured clone and link credential helpers working across CLI upgrades that replace installation symlinks.
- Keep machine checkout URLs matched to the configured API environment.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-13

- Add `CO_CONFIG_DIR` to isolate CLI sessions while preserving the host's browser preferences during login.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-07

- Add a Homebrew formula and release packaging for Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora/RHEL, and Arch Linux on x86_64 and ARM64.
- Document installation, upgrades, removal, and PATH setup in one platform-organized guide.
- Pin installer downloads to one release, use portable static Linux binaries by default, and replace binaries atomically after checksum verification.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-06

- Add non-interactive `co repo create [OWNER/]NAME` with private defaults, explicit visibility, and JSON output for humans and coding agents using an authorized machine session.
- Add agent registration and listing through `co agent register` and `co agent list`.
- Add human-approved repository access requests, resumable approval polling, and agent-scoped repository views through `co access request`, `co access wait`, and `co access view`.
- Move repository and release links to `codotcodes/co`.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-26

- Add authenticated `co clone` over the canonical co.codes smart HTTP URL.
- Add a host-scoped Git credential helper backed by the existing CLI session.
- Configure cloned repositories for authenticated fetch and push without storing tokens in Git configuration.
- Add `co link` for connecting an existing local repository to co.codes.
- Add configurable upstream names and optional colocated jj initialization to clone and link.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-25

- Add device authorization login and local session revocation.
- Add `whoami`, `repo view`, `doctor`, and version commands.
- Validate repository access in `clone` while smart HTTP remains unavailable.
- Add Linux and macOS release packaging, Nix support, and the global installer.
